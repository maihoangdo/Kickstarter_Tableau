# What correlations, patterns and trends do you see?
From the dataset, we can see the information of the projects based on the time its launched,
pledged amount in the project currency, project status by completion (successful or
unsuccessful), the number of projects by year, the amount of countries invests in those projects,
etc. based on two levels: category (called main_category in the dataset) and subcategory (called
category in the dataset).
It is interesting to see the categories that got the most funding attention, the trends of successful
projects by timeline, the majority of projects in Kickstarter are from the United states with
highest success projects. There has been increasing real funding amounts compared with the
goals.
# Who will be the audience of the dashboards? What questions would they ask about the
data?
Audiences: There will be the perspective of the project starters or backers or the company itself
(Kickstarter).
For Kickstarter project owner: The goal is to learn about what type of projects get successful so
that they can focus on marketing effort or decide if Kickstarter is a good fit.
For backers, project starters, to learn and understand successful projects can help them make
right decisions in evaluating risks related to pledging on Kickstarter.
# The questions they would ask about the data?
- What types of projects are being funded?
- What types of projects were successful or unsuccessful?
- What is the projects trend?
- What is the amount of successful project by country? Etc.
# How could a dashboard be used to show data clearly?
A good dashboard should include good and clear title of the data set and legend. The use of
charts helps audiences have a better understanding about the stories of the data and provide
meaningful insights without having unethical consideration. Thus, I will put the data into
differences categories to show that clearly and effectively.
